## Quick Start

1. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)

2. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    ```bash
    nextflow run main.nf -profile test
    ```

3. Start running your own analysis!

    ```bash
    nextflow run main.nf
    ```
